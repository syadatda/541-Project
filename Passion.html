          <h2>#1 Dancing ✨🕺💃 🎶</h2>
          <h3>Traditional Dance</h3>
          <p>I enjoy learning and performing various Malay traditional dances such as Zapin, Joget, and Inang. These dances are beautiful expressions of Malay culture and heritage.</p>

          <h2>#2 Listening to Songs ♬ ₊.🎧⋆ ‎♪ ⋆⁺ </h2>
          <h3>Songs</h3>
          <p>Besides dancing, I also enjoy listening to music and singing along. Ballads and R&B are my favorite genres. Singing helps me relax and express myself creatively.</p>

            <h2><center>#3 STUDY! 🌿•₊✧💻⋆⭒˚☕️｡⋆<br>Why I Love Studying?</center></h2>
            <p>While some might see studying as a chore, I find it engaging and rewarding. It keeps me busy and helps me learn and grow. Education is important to me, and I strive to achieve my full potential. My dream is to be awarded the prestigious ANC award, and I believe in dedication and hard work to reach my goals. The biggest competition is with myself, constantly pushing myself to improve and learn more.</p>

            <h3>Looking at the skies just heal me.</h3>
            <p>There's something magical about the way the sky transforms during sunset. I love witnessing those fleeting moments of color and capturing them in photos.</p>
